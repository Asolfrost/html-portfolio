<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>I'm rightly tired of the pain I hear and feel, boss. 
    I'm tired of bein on the road, lonely as a robin in the rain. 
    Not never havin no buddy to go on with or tell me where we's comin from or goin to or why. 
    I'm tired of people bein ugly to each other. It feels like pieces of glass in my head. 
    I'm tired of all the times I've wanted to help and couldn't. 
    I'm tired of bein in the dark. Mostly it's the pain. 
    There's too much. If I could end it, I would. But I can't.</p>

<h3>Avatar: The Way of the Water</h3>
